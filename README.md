# ML-Algos-From-Scratch
This repo is really for myself to learn. Learning the mathematical intricacies and translation to code of ML algos is a goal for me along with getting a stern intuition behind ML algos. The best way is to create them from scratch of course following tutorials then deviating on my own; so this repo will be the code base for just that. If you (the viewer) are on a similar journey feel free to use the notebooks to your pleasure.
